<h1>CoinWorks Library</h1>

A Java/Scala library for Bitcoin. The software was used for the following projects:



  
  <h3>3. [Under submission] ChainNet: Learning on Blockchain Graphs with Topological Features</h3>
  <p>Using persistent homology based ideas, we offer an elegant, easily extendable and computationally light approach for graph representation learning on Blockchain networks to predict cryptocurrency prices.</p>
  
 <h3>2. <a href = "http://cakcora.github.io/blockchain/576.pdf">Forecasting Bitcoin Price with Graph Chainlets </a> (PAKDD 2018) </h3>
  <p>We introduce a novel concept of chainlets, or Bitcoin subgraphs, which allows us to evaluate the local topological structure of the Bitcoin graph over time</p>
  
  <h3>1. <a href = "http://cakcora.github.io/blockchain/blockchainsurvey1_1.pdf">Blockchain: A Graph Primer</a></h3>
  <p>Aug 2017 Version 1.1</p>
  <p>We offer a holistic view on Blockchain. Starting with a brief history, we give the building blocks of Blockchain,
and explain their interactions. As graph mining has become a major part its analysis, we elaborate on graph theoretical
aspects of the Blockchain technology</p>
